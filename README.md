I am an IT Support Specialist at InVision Technology Solutions, a leading IT service provider for small and medium businesses. I hold the CompTIA A+, Security+, Network+, CSIS, and CIOS certifications, demonstrating my proficiency in IT fundamentals, network management, and cybersecurity.

I provide high-quality and timely support to our clients, ensuring that their IT systems and workflows are functioning smoothly and efficiently. I have strong skills in support, Servers and Active Directory, Networking, documentation through ITGlue, and hardware. I have experience in working with various IT platforms and tools, such as ZoHO, Fresh-desk, Office 365, Azure AD, RingCentral, and Cisco Meraki. I have also worked in the medical and utility sectors, testing and repairing large water meters and supporting medical facilities across Arizona.

I am open-minded, creative, and eager to learn new things and from my mistakes. I enjoy solving problems and delivering solutions that exceed expectations. I value teamwork, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. My goal is to continuously improve my IT skills and knowledge, and to contribute to the success and growth of InVision Technology Solutions and our clients.

I am currently studying on my own to gain several certifications such as CDSA, and the CCD.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
